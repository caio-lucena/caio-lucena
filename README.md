## Hello World!

- I’m Caio Lucena, an enthusiast of almost everything from the geeksphere (from The Elder Scrolls games to One Piece).
- Right now I'm studying "Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas" (something like "analysis and systems development")
  at [Fatec Carapicuíba](http://www.fateccarapicuiba.edu.br/) here in Brazil. This is a 3 years course (just like an associate degree).
- I’m interested in learn and grow in order to become a developer some day.
- The first programming language I learned was Java.
- By the way, I got a internship opportunity at [Sinqia](https://sinqia.com.br/) in February 2023 and I'm enjoying working with Java, Spring Boot, MSSQL, Pentaho and other tools.
- Update: I was promoted ! I'm a Software Engineer right now (August 2024).
