## Hello World!

- I’m interested in learn and grow in order to became a developer some day.
- The first programming language I learned was Java.
- BTW, I got a internship opportunity at [Sinqia](https://sinqia.com.br/) in February 2023 and I'm loving to work with Java, Spring Boot, MSSQL, Pentaho and others tools.
